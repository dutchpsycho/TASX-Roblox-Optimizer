# TASX Optimizer

TASX is a program designed to optimize Roblox's heavy over utilization of system resources, TASX optimizes RAM & CPU usage and optimizes threads. TASX is fully external and does not modify Roblox's memory.

## How does it run?

TASX is console-less, when you run it it'll dissapear. I'd reccomend putting it in startup, it uses no memory or CPU so it won't hurt your PC. To terminate it, open task manager & search ``TASX``.

## How do I use this?

For non-programmers, head over to the [TITAN Discord](https://titansoftwork.net/) & download the precompiled binary (This comes with source), to add it to startup run ``Windows + R`` & type ``shell:startup``, then drag ``TASX.exe`` in there.

For programmers, open the solution file & compile as debug/release (no difference).
